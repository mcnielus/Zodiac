          <h2>What Are Scorpios Like As Friends?</h2>
          <p>But you will have to realize that a Scorpio won't BS you or lie to you—and they will absolutely let you know when you haven't lived up to your potential. A Scorpio can be a friend for life, and can make you laugh harder, think deeper, and have more fun than you ever thought possible. </p>

          <h2>Sagittarius Love Style</h2>
          <p>Sagittarius loves witty back and forths, but also appreciates the formality of the dating experience. While they are 100% honest in any situation, they love an excuse to dress up and check out cool date night locations. They would much rather go to an under the radar speakeasy than hang out at home, and love impressing you with their knowledge of, well, pretty much everything and anything.</p>
